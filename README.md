**diary** is a low tech tool to mange image and text based references.

##Philosophy:
- static web based reference display
- easily store data in your cloud service of trust, no additional service/client
- alphabetical ordering with meta filters and tags
- easily create a print backup of your references using the browser print dialogue
- easily create custom displays of references or stats through accessible csv data storage 

##Some day maybe:
- rework the filters ui
- add date filters
- chrome plugin for saving images and pdfs: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted
- create a proper program setup 
- add preferences
    - data storage location
- implement custom subjective user filters (e.g. for managing projects or major categories)
