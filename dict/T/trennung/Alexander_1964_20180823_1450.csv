quote|"Indeed, since the book was published, a whole academic field has grown up around the idea of ""design methods"" - and I have been hailed as one of the leading exponents of these so-called design methods. I am very sorry that this has happened, and want to state, publicly, that I reject the whole idea of design methods as a subject of study, since I think it is absurd too separate the study of designing from the pratice of design.
