quote|[W]e need a way of setting out the problem which makes it perspicuous. [...] Two minutes with a pencil on the back of an envelope lets us solve [artithmetic] problems which we could not do in our heads if we tried for a hundred years. But as present we have no corresponding way of simplifying design problems for ourselves. The notes describe a way of representing design problems which  does make them easier to solve. It is a way of reducing the gap between the designer's small capacity and the great size of his task.
