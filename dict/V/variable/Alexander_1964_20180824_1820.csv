quote|Each binary variable stands for one possible kind of misfit between form and context. The value this variable takes, 0 or 1, describes a state of affairs that is not either in the form alone of in the context alone, but a relation between the two. The task of design is not to  create form which meets certain conditions, but to create such an order in the ensemble that all the variables take the value 0. The form is simply that part of the ensemble over which we have control.
