quote|"“Interactivity” indicates that at present a phase of fundamental change is being undergone in the ontological difference between humans and machines:
[...]Bruce Mazlish developed this insight further and pointed out that in order to cope with emerging social and cultural problems humans must accept the continuity of humans and machines. His thesis is that “man is breaking past the discontinuity between himself and machines.” Mazlish argues: Man is now becoming aware that “his own evolution is inextricably interwoven with his use and development of tools”, and that “the same scientific concepts help explain the workings of himself and of his machines.” At present the strongest scientific thesis in this sense is put forward by cognitive scientists: They argue that human beings are (logical) automata or that all natural human functions are best explained by (finite) automata in the sense of automata theory.
