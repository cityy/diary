quote|[E]very design problem begins with an effort to achieve fitness between two entities: the form in question and its context. [...][T]he real object of discussion is not the form alone but the ensemble comprising the form and its context. Good fit is a desired porperty of this ensemble which relates to some particular division of the ensemble into form and context.
