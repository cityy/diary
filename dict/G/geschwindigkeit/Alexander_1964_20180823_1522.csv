quote|At the same time that the problems increase in quantity, complexity, and difficulty, they also change faster than before. [...] The culture itself is changing faster than it has ever changed before. In the past [...] the individual designer would stand to some extent upon the shoulders of his predecessors. [...] There was always still some body of tradition which made his decisions easier. Now the last shreds of tradition are being torn from him. Since cultural pressures change so fast, any slow development of form becomes impossible. [...] For what once took many generations of gradual development is now attempted by a single individual. [...] The intuitive resolution of contemporary design problems simply lies beyond a single individual's integrative grasp.
