quote|The idea of representing a design problem as a direct graph is very general. It could be used to represent the dependencies between geometry, or between components, or even between more abstract ideas such as design decisions. The concept of graph-based dependency is quite understandable on a small scale. But for the designer (without any supporting software) it is difficult to apply on a scale that is appropriate to real-world problem solving.
