quote|[T]he opportunity to evaluate the form when it is away from its context depends on the fact that we can give a precise mathematical description of the context. In general, unfortunately, we cannot give an adequate description of the context we are dealing with. [I]t is just real world trial and error which we are trying to replace by a symbolic method, because real trial and error is too expensive and too slow. The experiment of putting a prototype form in the context itself is the real criterion of fit. Let us observe, first of all, that we should not really expect to be able to give a unitary description of the context for complex cases: if we could do so, there would be no problems of design. The context and the form are complementary.
