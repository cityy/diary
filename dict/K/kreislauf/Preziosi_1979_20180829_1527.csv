quote|In the writer's view, both semiotics and perceptual psychology rightly reject the role of the viewer or observer oor decoder or reader as a passive cryptographer and affirm that semiosis and perception are cyclic, temporral, and interactive activities oriented toward the significative construal and production of information. We  may very well suggest, more than impressionistically, that in their fundamental mechanics they are metonymically related as two sides of the same coin, and metaphorically related by their equivalencies of process.
