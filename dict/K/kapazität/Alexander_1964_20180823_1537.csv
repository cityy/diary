quote|If we look at the lack of organization of lack of clairy of the forms around us, it is plain that their design has often taxed their designer's cognitive capacity well beyond the limit. [...] In practice it is clear that there are limits of some sort. Similarly, the very frequent failure of designers to produce well organizd forms strongly suggests that there are limits to the individual designer's capacity.
