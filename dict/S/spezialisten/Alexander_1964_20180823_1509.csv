quote|Today more and more design problems are reaching insoluble levels of complexity. [...] To match the growing complexity of problems, there is a growing body of infortmation and specialist experience. [...] The technical difficulties of grasping all the information needed for the construction of such a form are out of hand - and well beyond the fingers of a single individual.
