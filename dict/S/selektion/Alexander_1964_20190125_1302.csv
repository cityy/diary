quote|"To solve a problem by selection, two things are necessary:

1. It must be possible to generate a wide enough range of possible alternative solutions symbolically.
2. It must be possible to express all the criteria for solution in terms of the same symbolism. 

[...] It is at once obvious that wherever this kind of process is possible, we do nto need to ""design"" a solution. [...] Whether we accept this or not, the converse anyway is true. Those problems of creating form that are traditionally called ""design problems"" all demand invention."
