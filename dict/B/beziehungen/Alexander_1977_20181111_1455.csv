quote|"If the elements are different every time that they occur, evidently then, it cannot be the elements themselves which are repeating in a building or a town: these so-called elements cannot be the ultimate ""atomic"" constituents of space. [...]
Beyond its elements each building [or urban region] is defined by certain  patterns of relationships among elements. [...] Evidently, then, a large part of the ""structure"" of a building or a town consists of patterns of relationships. [...] [T]hese relationships are not exra, but necessary to the elements, indeed part of them. [...] [T]he elements themselves are patterns of relationships. [...] 
And finally, the things which seem like elements, dissolve, and leave a fabric of relationships behind, which is the stuff that actually, repeats itself, and gives the structure to a building or town."
