quote|When we speak of bad fit we refer to a single identifiable property of an ensemble. [...] It seems as though in practice the concept of good fit, describing only the absense of such failures and hence leaving us nothing concrete to refer to in explanation, can only be explained indirectly; it is, in practice as it were, the disjunction of all possible misfits. [W]e should always expect to see the process of achieving good fit between two entities as a negative process of neutralizing the incongruities, or irritants, or forces, which cause misfit.
