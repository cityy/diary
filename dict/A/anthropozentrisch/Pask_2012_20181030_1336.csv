quote| [...] A building cannot be viewed simply in isolation. It is only meaningful as a human environment. It perpetually interacts with its inhabitants, on the one hand serving them and on the other hand controlling their behaviour. In other words, structures make sense as parts of larger systems that include human components and the architect is primarily concerned with these larger systems. They are what architects design. [...] The concept of functionalism can be usefully refined in a humanistic direction.
