quote|"An aesthetically potent environment is an environment of any sort [...] that people are liable to enjoy and which servers to shape their enjoyment. [...] The quality of ""aesthetic potency"", although it determines the framework of which artistic communication can take place, is primarily attached to a relation between the environment and the hearer or viewer. An aesthetically potential environment encourages the hearer or viewer to explore it, to learn about it, to form an hierarchy of concepts that refer to it; further it guides his exploration; in a sense, it makes him participate in, or at any rate see himself reflect in, the environment."
