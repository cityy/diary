quote|The actor-network theory has very little to do with the study of social networks. [...] Although AT shares this distrust for such vague all encompassing sociological terms it aims at describing also the vary nature of societies. But to do so it does not limit itself to human individual actors but extend the word actor -or actant- to non-human, non-individual entities. [...] AT aims at accounting for the very essence of societies and natures [...] to rebuild social theory out of networks.
