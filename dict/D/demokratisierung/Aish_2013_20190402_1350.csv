quote|"There are conflicting opinions about 2D drafting. Some have criticised 2D drafting systems as having a conservative influence on architecture because it perpetuated the use of drawings long after more advanced modeling technologies were available.
Others have commented that the widespread adoption of 2D drafting could be claimed to be the 'democratisation' of technology. But the challenge is not how to 'democratise' the superficial aspects of a technology ( in this case the graphic display and the input devices of sketchpad), but how to 'democratise' the underlying concepts (in this case the constraint system): indeed the real challenge is how to 'democratise' thoughtfulness. 

In fact it takes real effort to re-establish the vision of the original innovators (such as Sutherland), that CAD is not a better way to draw but a deeper way to think."
