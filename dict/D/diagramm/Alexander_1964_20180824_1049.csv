quote|[T]he form is the diagram of forces. Once we have the diagram of forces in the literal sense (that is, the field description of the context), this will in essense also desceribe the form as a complementary diagram of forces. What does make design a problem in real world cases is that we are trying to make a diagram for forces whoses field we do not understand.  Understanding the field of the context and inventing a form to fit it are really two aspects of the same process.
