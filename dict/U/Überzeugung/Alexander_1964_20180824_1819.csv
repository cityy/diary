quote|In the case of  a real design problem, even our conviction that there is such a thing as fit to be achieved is curiously flimsy and insubstantial. We are searching for some kind of harmony between to intangibles: a form which we have not yet designed, and a context which we cannot properly describe. The only reason we have for thinking that there must be some kind of fit to be achieved between them is that we can detect incongruities, or negative instances of it. If we agree to treat fit as the absence of misfites, and to use a list of those potential misfits which are most likely to occure as our criterion for fit, our theory will at least have the same nature as our intuitive conviction that there is a problem to be solved.
