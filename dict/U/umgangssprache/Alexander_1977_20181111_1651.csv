quote|"As we make the different individual languages, we find the patterns overlap. [...]
And, more subtly, we find also that different patterns in different languages, have underlying similarities, which suggest that they can be reformulated to make them more general, and usable in a greater variety of cases. [...]
Gradually it becomes clear that it is possible to construct one much larger language, which contains all the patterns from the individual languages, and unifies them by tying them together in one larger structure. [...]
Gradually, as people modify these published languages, add to them, erase from them, a pool of common languages, unique to different places, unique to individuals, and yet broadly shared, will evolve of its own accord. [...]
Of course, this evolution will never end. "
