quote|As long as two buildings share the same space or are in each other's proximity, whether the architect wants it or not, nor whether anybody cares, they do have a relationship. It is an enormous farce to believe that to create a relationship, one thing has to be like another thing, or one thing has to adjust to another thing. As anybody who shares the world with anybody else knows, the simple proximity - the simple juxtaposition of things - creates a relationship that is there, almost independent of the mutual will of the people who created these objects.
