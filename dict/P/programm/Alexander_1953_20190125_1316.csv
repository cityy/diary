quote|"The way to imrpove this [wrong mental picture of a context] is to make a furhter abstract picture of our first picture of the problem, which eradicates its bias and retains only its abstract structural features; this second picture may then be examined according to precisely defined operations, in a wway not subject to the bias of language and experience. [...]
The vague and unsatisfactory picture of the context's demands, C2, which first develops in the designer's mind, is followed by this mathematical picture, C3. [...]
This this picture, C3, is built out of mathematical entities, called ""sets"". A set, just as its name suggests, is any collection of things whatever, without regard to common properties, and has no internal structure until it is given one. [...]
The great power and beauty of the set, as an analytical tool for design problems, is that its elements can be as various as they need be. [...]
[The program is the mathematical decomposition of a problem with a set of misfits M and a set of interactions L by probability]. We call it a program because it provides directions or instructions to the designer, as to which subsets M are its significant ""pieces"", and so which major aspects of the problem he should apply himself to. This program is a reorganization of the way the designer thinks about the problem."
