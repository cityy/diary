quote|What was so radical about Wiener's studies was that cybernetics, as he himself described it, used a theory of probability to regulate the transmission and feedback of information as a means of calculating and automating the behaviour of mechanical and biological systems. In other words, cybernetics outlined parallels between the ways computers and the human brain process and communicate information.
