quote|Photographers are very interesting, their view of the project is always original, often the best. I don’t believe that architectural space can be expressed through traditional photography. Andreas Gursky and Jeff Wall use photography as if it were painting and this is what we love most. They don’t show a building, they represent something else, an autonomous space from the expressive viewpoint.
