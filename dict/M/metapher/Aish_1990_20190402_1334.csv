quote|Object oriented software is based on a metaphor between real-world objects and computational objects. A specific assumption is made that a convenient 'user model' for software developers is one which mimics some of the attributes and beaviour of real-world objects. A CAD system is based on the inverse metaphor, that a convenient 'user model' for architects and designers is one where real-world objects (such as buildings) are represented as a computational system. An object-oriented CAD System is therefore a circular metaphor in which OO software concepts, derived from the real world, are re-applied to the design of furhter real world objects.
