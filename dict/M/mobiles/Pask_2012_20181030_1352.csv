quote|"It is a group of objects, the individual mobiles, that engage in the discourse, that compete, cooperate and learn about another. [...] Each individual has a set of programs that determine its motions and its visible state. Each individual learns how to deploy its programs in order to achieve a goal [...]. Its level of ""satisfaction"" is reflected partly in its behaviour and partly in a visual display. "
