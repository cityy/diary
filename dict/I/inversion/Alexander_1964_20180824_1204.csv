quote|[I]n pratice we see good fit only from a negative point of view, as the limiting case where there are no high spots. [...] Yet it is such departures from the norm which stand out in our minds, rather than the norm itself. Their wrongness is somehow more immediate than the rightness of less peculiar behavior, and therefore more compelling. [...] It is the aspects of our lives which are obsolete, incongruous, or out of tune that catch our attention. [...] We should find it almost impossible to characterize a house which fits its context. Yet it is the easiest thing in the world to name the specific kinds of misfit which prevent good fit. Because they are expressed in negative form they are specific, and tangible enough to talk about.
