quote|I can easily make changes in the Boundary. [...] There are two sides to this tendency designers have, to change the definition of the problem. On the one hand, the impractical idealism of designers who want to redesign entire cities and whole processes of manufacture when they are asked to design simple objects is often only an attempt to loosen difficult contraints by stretching the form-context boundary. On the other hand, this way in which the good designer keeps an eye on possible changes at every point of the ensemble is part of his job. [...] This ability to deal with several layers of form-context boundaries in concert is an important part of what we often refer to as the designer's sense of organization.
