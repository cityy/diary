quote|In less than a century the two principles on which the Koepel (panopticum prison) was based - centralized monitoring and solitary confinement - have been undone or even reversed by cultural change. At the same time, the building itself - simply by continuing to exist - has responded to these ideological changes by dismantling the Panopticon Principle and adding complementary facilities. Changes in regime and ideology are more powerful than the most radical architecture - a conclusion both alarming and reassuring for the architect.
