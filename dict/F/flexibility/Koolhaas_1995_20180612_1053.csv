quote|Flexibility is not the exhaustive anticipation of all possible changes. Most changes are unpredictable. [...] Flexibility is the creation of margin - excess capacity that enables different and even opposite interpretations and uses. [...] New architecture lacking this kind of excess, is doomed to a permanent state of alteration if it is to adjust to even minor ideological or practical changes.
