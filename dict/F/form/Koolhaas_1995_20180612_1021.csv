quote|"[...] the wall also, in my eyes, made a total mockery of any of the emerging attempts to link FORM to MEANING in a regressive chain-and-ball relationship. It was clearly about communication, semantic maybe, but its meaning changed almost daily, sometimes by the hour. It was affected more by events and decisions thousands of miles away than by its physical manifestation. Its significance as a ""wall"" - as an object - was marginal; its impact was utterly independent of its appearance. Apparently the lightes of objects could be randomly coupled with the heaviest of meanings through brute force, willpower. [...] I would never again believe in form as the primary vessel of meaning."
