quote|According to a distinction introduced by the French philosopher Gilbert Simondon, tools are used to manipulate the world, whereas instruments are characterized by a feedback structure, because they are able to inform the user’s senses (Simondon 1989). [...] Even very simple objects like a hammer can be described as a tool as well as an instrument, depending on the operation exerted. You can use a hammer to drive a nail into a certain surface, but you can also utilize it in order to learn more about the properties of a certain material, e.g. if it is solid or hollow.
