quote|"In our more permisse moments, we have surrendered to the asethetics of chaos - ""our"" chaos. But in the technical sense chaos is what happens when nothing happens, not something that can be engineered or embraced; it is something that infilitrates; it cannot be fabricated. The only legitimate relationships that architects can have with the subject of chaos is to take their rightful place in the army of those devoted to resist it, and fail."
